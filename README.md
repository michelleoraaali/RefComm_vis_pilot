Work with Paula Rubio-Fernandez and Julian Jara-Ettinger.
Looking at efficiency in referential communication through a series of tasks (adapting JsPsych) looking at color and material adjectives. 

More theoretical details forthcoming!

Three tasks:

1. Norming - acceptability judgements for stimuli
2. Discrimination - are people faster at discriminating between objects on the basis of a color adjective than a material adjective?
3. Production - details forthcoming

ColMat - refers to tasks in which the first block is related to color adjective and the second is related to the material adjectives. MatCol is vice versa.
